Make sure to launch "init.sql" before launching functional tests.
"clean.sql" will remove all test-specific data.

These test are provided as a plugin. To enable them, you must add it in the
OPM configuration file (opm.conf) :

"modules" : [ "grapher", "t" ];

Then open the "http://host:port/t/test" page. It will detect every *.html file in the
"modules/t/public/tests/src/" directory.
If your server doesn't listen on port 4000, you have to change the 5th line in
the "01_acl.html" file.
